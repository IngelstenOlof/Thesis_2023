# Bachelors Thesis Interaction Design 2023
## Designing a solution overview visualisation for the UX-team at Inter IKEA
The digital landscape internally at IKEA is very large which presents an issue for the UX Designers tasks with maintaining and supporting developers. The amount of solutions leads to designer not knowing the context in which they are working.

## This Repo
This is a testing ground for D3.js prototypes that visualise the solutions at the department of "Product Range and Development" within IKEA of Sweden.

## Prototypes
The focus of the early prototypes have been on learning the library and to test for the functionalities i'm interested in exploring.
